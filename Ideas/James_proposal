The problem â€“ different media sources take very different perspectives on the same event.

Many consumers of media will read / consume one source, believe it to be the truth and will be unaware of potential bias.

We will develop a game highlighting how the same story can be presented in very different ways, and therefore highlight to people how they should consume media from a range of sources to gain the most balanced view

We would achieve this through scraping twitter for headlines from different news outlets (from the UK only).

Technical challenges:
- different media outlets may not publish work on the same story - for instance, there is no 'environment' section in the Sun newspaper website, but there is in the Guardian.

App design:
I envisage the user being presented with two headlines, with the names of two newspapers, and they must drag and drop the headline to the correct paper.
When they review their answer, they are presented with links to both stories.
