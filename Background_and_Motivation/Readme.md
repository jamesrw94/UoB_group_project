# Background and Related Work
To date, a wide variety of general knowledge quiz websites exist for users to engage with for free, such as; [JetPunk](https://www.jetpunk.com/), [Buzzfeed Quizzes](https://www.buzzfeed.com/uk/quizzes), [Challenge the brain](https://www.challengethebrain.com/), [Quiz UK](http://www.quiz.co.uk/) and [Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/). While these are great fun, and can increase one’s knowledge of certain topics, we feel that there is scope for this paradigm to be expanded into a more serious direction. While quiz websites certainly work within the paradigm of Serious Play, the emphasis is more on Play, and less on Serious. With no clear objective/issue implicit in the implementation of these quiz sites, we’ve delved a little deeper to uncover where quizzes might be used in order to help raise awareness of cultural issues.

## Related work
One area which seems to have some traction is media bias and fake news. A few websites currently exist with the goal of somehow improving the general public’s awareness of their own actions online through the quiz format. Below is a brief overview of some websites taking this approach:

1.	[Should you share it?](https://newslit.org/educators/resources/should-you-share-it/) – Targets fake news as the problem to solve and aims to improve their users’ awareness of what content is likely fake or reliable so that they can better decide what to share with others in the future. Through this, the project hopes to reduce the amount of fake news circulating the web.

2.	[University of Akron Fake News Quiz](https://akron.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2bhqIwpegOtj5yZ) – Without a clear agenda outwardly specified on their site, this quiz game will be treated as a stand-alone idea. The quiz asks users to decide whether various news clippings are credible. The user is provided with links to the sources of the clippings, and then asked if they are legitimate news stories. After the user decides, the right answer is revealed along with some information about how certain features made it more/less likely to be reliable news.

3.	[Facticious](http://factitious.augamestudio.com/#/) - Without a clear agenda outwardly specified on their site, this quiz game will be treated as a stand-alone idea. Like the University of Akron example, this quiz works by asking users to determine if a news clipping is real or fake. The name of the source is initially hidden, and only provided to the user after a button click. Unlike the previous example, this game features a points-based system, whereby a user gains/losses points based on their answers to the questions.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesrw94/UoB_group_project/main/Sprints_%26_Project_Management/Readme_Images/facticious_answer.png" width="600"/></p>

4.	[ClearThinking](http://programs.clearerthinking.org/political_bias_test.html#.VdbziFNViko) – A USA targeted political ideology affiliation test. A user’s political ideology is evaluated through a set of general knowledge questions surrounding areas believed to be of political significance such as environmental concerns and the economy. The user is then scored based on their answers regarding each of these categories, and this is then used to determine a user’s political leanings.

## The issue
The emphasis in these quiz sites is placed on fake news and political leanings, but we feel there is a more fundamental issue at hand. We feel that, through many of the mechanisms being highlighted in the above quiz sites, there is a societal tendency to stereotype media sources as having a tone of voice that is permanently wrong or simply biased against the world narrative they believe. 

Media bias is a growing problem in society with the potential to have significant impact over government and culture. _Administration and Policy: An Asia-Pacidfic Journal_ stated "The impact of social media on a country’s political psyche cannot be underestimated. Increasingly, political polarization is perpetuated by media bubbles, creating environments where individuals are not exposed to conflicting perspectives challenging their beliefs."(Lee, 2019, p. 15). Ownership and accountability for information seems to be watered down on a daily basis, and people are finding it difficult to navigate the mass of conflicting narratives. The _International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications_ stated "In the age of mass information and misinformation, the  corporate  duty  of  developers  of browsers,  social  media,  and search  engines  are  falling  short  of  the  minimum  standards  of responsibility." (Safieddine, Masri, Pourghomi, 2016 p. 1). We are concerned that because of this, people are increasingly gravitating towards narrative camps where their world view is represented consistently by a select few media sources, leading to division between camps (Fauchs, C, 2021, p. 218) and an inherent sense of mistrust (Lee, T, 2019, p. 17). This can be thought of as a bias of inherent value in different media sources, and we suspect one which manifests itself in people losing the ability to recognize the sources they discredit. There are many potential factors with a direct influence, but one that sticks out is mentioned in _Mass communication and society_ whereby "partisans prominently rely on source cues to anticipate agreement in news coverage and to decide whether to read an article. Source cues that convey a certain partisanship can influence perceptions of the outlet’s credibility and bias"(Van Duyn, E & Collier, J), implying that a media consumer is making subconcious judgements about the information being received subject to the media outlet delivering it.

## The solution
The quiz-based websites highlighted above demonstrate a current standard we can draw from in order to tackle the societal issues in a fun and accessible way. With the general popularity of the quiz-based game on the internet, it seems like the perfect vehicle to challenge, entertain and educate our potential users in a format familiar to them.

The simplicity of the quiz format will enable us to strip back unnecessary functionality and focus on the core benefit to the user. With the problem of information bias being such a polarising topic, we feel that a quiz game built to reveal one’s own biases of inherent information value towards different media sources would be the best way to build upon the industry work carried out to date.

## The audience
The potential demographic for our proposed solution is best represented as adults who regularly consume news media with an interest in how news is portrayed. While the solution could be tailored to appeal to more specific demographics, we chose to keep the concept broad in the outset. Doing so allows us to employ a user-testing process further down the line to tailor our application to more granular audiences should they present themselves. In the meantime, we aim to keep the application's potential demographic as broad as possible to ensure maximum inclusion and avoid excluding any unforeseen user groups the application could benefit. Although the goal impact of our solution will be to educate and entertain our users, we move forward from this point aware that we are examining, and could potentially place users under stress with the potential to embarrass them. We hope that any negative reactions/experiences will become apparent in user testing throughout the development process.

## Scope
While we understand the scale of the problem to be well beyond any scope of a university group project, we hope that through this experience we can:
1.	Encourage our users to think more about their own biases and make a proactive effort to measure their opinions.
2.	Facilitate a culture within ourselves of developing tools with an eye for the personal and societal impact of our work as we continue with the course and on to professional environments.
