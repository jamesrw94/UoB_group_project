# Background and Related Work
There is no shortage of general knowledge quiz websites such as [JetPunk](https://www.jetpunk.com/), [Buzzfeed Quizzes](https://www.buzzfeed.com/uk/quizzes), [Challenge the brain](https://www.challengethebrain.com/), [Quiz UK](http://www.quiz.co.uk/) and [Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/). While these are great fun, and can increase one’s knowledge of certain topics, we feel that there is scope for this paradigm to be expanded into a more serious direction. While quiz websites certainly work withing the paradigm of Serious Play, the emphasis is more on Play, and less on Serious. With no clear objective/issue implicit in the implementation of these quiz sites, we’ve delved a little deeper to uncover where quizzes might be used in order to help raise awareness of cultural issues we might currently be blind to recognising within ourselves.

## Related work
One area which seems to have some traction is media bias and fake news. A few websites currently exist with the goal of somehow improving the general public’s awareness of their own actions online through the quiz format. Below is a brief overview of some websites taking this approach:

1.	[Should you share it?](https://newslit.org/educators/resources/should-you-share-it/) – Targets fake news as the problem to solve and aims to improve their users’ awareness of what content is likely fake or reliable so that they can better decide what to share with others in the future. Through this, the project hopes to reduce the amount of fake news circulating the web.

2.	[University of Akron Fake News Quiz](https://akron.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2bhqIwpegOtj5yZ) – Without a clear agenda outwardly specified on their site, this quiz game will be treated as a stand-alone idea. The quiz asks users to decide whether various news clippings are credible. The user is provided with links to the sources of the clippings, and then asked if they are legitimate stories. After the user decides, the right answer is revealed along with some information about how certain features made it more/less likely to be reliable news.

3.	[Facticious](http://factitious.augamestudio.com/#/) - Without a clear agenda outwardly specified on their site, this quiz game will be treated as a stand-alone idea. Like the University of Akron example, this quiz works by asking users to determine if a news clipping is real or fake. The name of the source is initially hidden, and only provided to the user after a button click. Unlike the previous example, this game features a points-based system, whereby a user gains/losses points based on their answers to the questions.

4.	[ClearThinking](http://factitious.augamestudio.com/#/) – A USA targeted political ideology affiliation test. A user’s political ideology is evaluated through a set of general knowledge questions surrounding areas believed to be of political significance such as environmental concerns and the economy. The user is then scored based on their answers regarding each of these categories, and this is then used to determine a user’s political leanings.

## The issue
The emphasis in these quiz sites is placed on fake news and political leanings, but we feel there is a more fundamental issue at hand. We feel that, through many of the mechanisms being highlighted in the above quiz sites, there is a societal tendency to stereotype media sources as having a tone of voice that is permanently wrong or simply biased against the world narrative they believe. 

We feel that media bias is a growing problem in society with the potential to have significant impact over government and culture [2]. Ownership and accountability for information seems to be watered down on a daily basis, and people are finding it difficult to navigate the mass of conflicting narratives [3]. We are concerned that because of this, people are increasingly gravitating towards narrative camps where their world view is represented consistently by a select few media sources, leading to division between camps [4] and an inherent sense of mistrust [2]. This can be thought of as a bias of inherent value in different media sources, and we suspect one which manifests itself in people being so far removed from sources they deem to be of lesser value that they cant recognize them.

## The solution
The quiz-based websites highlighted above demonstrate a current standard we can draw from in order to tackle the societal issues in a fun and accessible way. With the general popularity of the quiz-based game on the internet, it seems like the perfect vehicle to challenge, entertain and educate our potential users in a format familiar to them.

The simplicity of the quiz format will enable us to strip back unnecessary functionality and focus on the core benefit to the user. With the problem of information bias being such a polarising topic, we feel that a quiz game built to reveal one’s own biases of inherent information value towards different media sources would be the best way to build upon the industry work carried out to date.

## Scope
While we understand the scale of the problem to be well beyond any scope of a university group project, we hope that through this experience we can:
1.	Encourage our users to think more about their own biases and make a proactive effort to measure their opinions.
2.	Facilitate a culture within ourselves of developing tools with an eye for the personal and societal impact of our work as we continue with the course and on to professional environments.
