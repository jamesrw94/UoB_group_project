# Evaluation

## Design Prototyping

Our opinion of prototyping was that it was incredibly useful. The prototypes allowed us to involve the user in the design process and get feedback on designs before we hardcoded them. We found paper and digital prototyping had different strengths and weaknesses but they were equally useful in the creation and development of our design.

### Paper Prototype (Completed 2nd of March)

The first development that occurred after ideation was creating a “paper” prototype on Microsoft PowerPoint.

#### Paper Prototype Strengths
1.	Assess ideas quickly and remove elements without investing too much time on them if they didn’t work well.
2.	Quick to produce in comparison to higher-fidelity prototypes
3.	It provided a creative outlet for us to work on as a group
4.	It improved our communication by getting us onto the same page and focused on the same design.

#### Paper Prototype Limitations
1.	People interact with paper differently to actual screens
2.	Limited interactivity/context (tweets/content did not change in our paper prototype)

Despite its limitations paper prototyping played a key part in developing our idea, allowing everyone to easily contribute to the design.  While we were collaboratively working people developed their own versions of pages before we settled on the final design. 

### Digital Prototype (Completed 9th of March)

The limitations of the paper prototype led us to develop a higher-fidelity prototype of our design. 

#### Digital Prototype Strengths
1.	As the prototype was stored online, it could be shared easily with potential users as an URL in the survey itself.
2.	The digital prototype allowed us to simulate most of the interactions between the user and the application, providing us with a lot more information about their interactions.
3.	We received richer feedback using user testing, allowing more informed, user-centred decisions to be made.
4.	Able to easily perform quantitative user surveys


#### Digital Prototype Limitations
1.	It was a lot more time consuming, than paper prototyping.
2.	The platform we used could not fully recreate the application we desired to create.


## User Tests

### User Survey (Released 22nd of March)

The survey included pre user test questions on demographics such as age, gender, profession and location. More targeted questions were then asked regarding their knowledge of newspapers.  Once they had performed the user test, they were asked questions related to the design and purpose of the website.

The hope was to be able to gain insights into our target demographic, to be able to improve our design for their user needs.  Several insights were gleaned from the survey which had a direct impact on the design:

1.	The survey was incredibly useful in assigning a name to our single page application, something we were struggling with a decision on.
2.	It allowed us to understand where people were finding difficulties on the website

For a full lists of insights please check the User Report **[here]( https://github.com/jamesrw94/UoB_group_project/blob/main/UX_Design/Report.pptx)**.  Despite the useful information we gained from user surveys, we found there were some limitations:

1.	We could not study user behaviour on the site, to see when they are pausing or where exactly they are getting stuck.
2.	Preparation of the questions took quite a lot of time to ensure they were worded correctly, ensuring bias and leading questions were removed as much as possible.
3.	Difficult to establish what usability problems there are with the product.

The insights from the user survey led us to creating a moderated user test, as we felt we wanted more qualitative data to help drive our design forward.

### Moderated User Test (Performed 1st of April / 2nd of April)

During moderated user testing you have the chance to observe the user operating the prototype which can give very different and more comprehensive insights than the user survey provided.  It also provided a platform to allow me to clarify any confusion the user had during the user test, directing them away from features that do not work as intended.

#### Limitations
1.	Planning, organizing and executing the user tests is time consuming, and a lot more hands on than user surveys.
2.	Documenting the results also is time intensive as the videos had to be replayed to gain quotes, afterwards comparing the user journeys to gain insights.
3.	Moderating bias/errors could have a significant impact on results as the sample size is much lower.

On the whole, user prototyping and testing was an incredibly valuable tool for us to ensure the application would satisfy the user needs. Many useful insights were highlighted which were later used in the design by the front and back end.
