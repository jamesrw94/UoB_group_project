# Conclusion #

## Working practices ##

Throughout the project, we found that our working practices worked well and helped us to produce good output together.

We enjoyed working using Scrum methodology as it allowed us to review our work frequently and adapt as necessary. It gave us the ability to change the scope of our MVP as the project progressed and the whole project was split into manageable chunks of work.

We used JIRA to track and manage our issues, which we found to be useful as a 'single source of truth' of our to-do items. The JIRA board formed the basis of our weekly meetings and helped us to keep track of what had been finished, what work was ongoing and what still needed to be started. The ability to assign tickets was useful, so that everyone knew who was responsible for which ticket of work. Also, keeping the ticket status up to date - from 'Todo", to 'In Progress', to 'Done' - was useful as it allowed any of us to see how we were performing mid sprint.

We found that our communication channels worked well, despite Covid restrictions meaning we could not meet face to face, and we communicated regularly as a group throughout the entire project via Teams or our Discord server.

## Future work ## 

In terms of future work we have found 3 possible avenues to improve the end product. These avenues link directly with our Project objectives. 

Our first objective, set out at the beginning of the project,  was to design an application with quiz game functionality. Although we achieved this, in the future it would be beneficial to flesh out the quiz further by adding in user sessions and having users answer multiple questions in a row. This would develop the play aspect of our serious play project.

Our second objective was to populate our database using the Twitter API. This objective was met, but it would be even better to develop a system in which new tweets were periodically inserted into the database automatically instead of having to manually insert the json files ourselves. To complement this, we could also introduce a way of selecting topics dynamically from what was currently trending on twitter. This would allow the website to keep its relevance by automatically updating itself without human interference. 

The last two objectives of our app were based around highlighting user bias towards the media. In the current app we only show information about the newspapers that featured in the previous question but in the future it would be great to expand this into its own page, where you could get statistics regarding all of the newspapers at once. This could further help highlight the bias within the media as it would allow users to more easily compare each newspapers performance.
