### Reflective discussion of the success of the project
Overall, the project has successfully accomplished the goals initially set out. The process has been a valuable learning experience for the team as well as an opportunity to engage in group work with notable challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly feel that as a group we have risen to these challenges and even adapted to the environment in our favour.

Through the development process, we have successfully created a single page web app with quiz functionality. This application uses a MongoDB database of tweets, regularly updated to keep content fresh and reacts to the user’s engagement in the front end. The front end uses the Angular framework with a Node.js application server. When the user submits answers to the quiz, the database is updated to both inform the user if they were correct and presents overall information on the success of users with regards to the current quiz. Through this mechanism, the user is confronted with the reality of how accurately they Know the News as well as a more general feel of how well other people perform. Through everything outlined here, we have achieved our [projects goals](/README.md/#project-objectives) and look forward to future development opportunities.

While the scope of our project is small, we felt that a positive experience (hopefully a learning experience) was at the core of our motivation as a group and should remain central to our application’s development (as seen in [Background & Motivation](/Background_and_Motivation/#scope)). As demonstrated in our user-acceptance testing, the application can be fun as well as educational. We feel this is a terrific achievement for our team as we understand the challenges in developing an application people want to use. Keeping the user at the centre of our design process enabled periodic checking in order to make sure we were never going completely off course. As well as this, the lecturers and teaching assistants on this unit from University of Bristol have provided invaluable guidance, always providing honest feedback and nudging us in the right direction should we ever find ourselves drifting. 

While the user was kept at the centre of the design process and we used their input to help with certain decisions such as the name of the application and the number of tweets to be displayed, the MVP was always a decision we made independently. Keeping the core product definition as something we owned ourselves, we were able to set realistic workload expectations and rarely had tickets carrying over from one sprint to the next.

In some ways, workload management has been made easier by the current pandemic. With the lives of our team members being so constrained, it is easier to plan meetings and communally discuss tickets when the default way to meet is from your computer. We chose not to keep to the strict 10-minute stand-up meetings popular with scrum, because it gave us a chance to catch up socially and run through the status of the project in more detail. Without any other contact outside of meetings, we found it useful to spend more time running through ideas in order to ensure everyone got the best educational experience out of the project as possible. Towards the end of the project, we inevitably began specializing and with this came more granular communication between some team members. In order to combat any disparity on the current state of the application and where it should be, we regularly held meeting with the sole purpose of one team member explaining the work they had been doing to the team in a format like our labs on Teams. Through this, we all gained as thorough an understanding of full stack development as possible, enabling highly engaged collaboration throughout the project despite pandemic-related circumstances preventing in-person meetings.
