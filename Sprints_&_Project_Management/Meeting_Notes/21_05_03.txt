Main summary
- Agreed to hold daily stand ups for this final week before submission
- Agreed that this Sprint should finish on Wednesday, giving us time for a final review prior to hand-in on Friday
- Our App MVP has been completed

Notes:
- James showed people how to search for previous sprints by using the JIRA filter
- Realise some of the front end and UX documentation is overlapping.
- Joe to include the heuristics document for front-end write-up
- Dan provided some feedback from Stuart - we are in a decent position documentation wise. Previous yearsâ€™ reports shared with each other for comparison.
- need a set of instructions for the user, above the intro. Dan happy to write this.
- video on prototypes. Demo video. Joe to do demo.
- An error was spotted in our App MVP where the results graph was not updating properly in certain cases. We agreed to flag it as a bug, but to focus on documentation for now rather than fixing it
- Conclusion and Evaluation writers have not been assigned. We agreed that each of us should focus on what we already have, and then assign these remaining parts.

System Implmentation:
- Dan has done middle tier but will more explicitly flag it up in his backend documentation
- Additional elements - data scraping
- docker - Deployment details, James to add
