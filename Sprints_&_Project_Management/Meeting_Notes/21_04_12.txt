All team members present.

Sprint Review of Sprint 2:
- Noted that the show and tells were very useful
- Routing has been successfully set up in the FrontEnd.
- Issues with persisting our db data - we realise that data is not persisted once a container wiped down, and volumes are particular to a single machine. Therefore will need a insertion script for users to run.


Kicked off Sprint 3 - please see JIRA screenshots. 

Aim of the sprint is to connect to the API and get one question page (brexit) functioning in the front end.
