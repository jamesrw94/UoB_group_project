Paul reviewd our work with the following actions for us to folow up on:

	- Joe to add blurb to homepage explaining what the tool does, and also to the stats page telling the user what the charts show
	- Joe to investigate how much work would be involved in fixing the re-sizing of the screen

Other general actions:
	- James to write up our submission txt file, including instructions for the .env file.

Paul reviewed our work so far:

Background & Motivation:
	- Paul - is this too academic? Language is too academic for this kind of project.Although Paul hasn’t looked at mark scheme. As a github project, don’t need academic writing.
	- discussion on solution - can talk about gamification.
	- good practice to link to sources in online writing, but recognises we can’t do that with our academic references here
	- scoping - we can say what we are not trying to do


App demo:
	- on first page - expecting one paragrph on what the tool aims to do
	- make the stats page clearer. add some blurb to the top saying what it is showing
	- bar charts would be better than pie charts
	- design is retro.
	- when resizing screen size, the tweets overlap each other


General team discussion:
	- Dan has fixed a db issue which meant that sometimes tweets weren’t showing up
	- Joe has added a darker background to the ‘drag logo into box’ instruction to help users view it
