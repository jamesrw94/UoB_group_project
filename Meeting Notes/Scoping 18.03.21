General discussion:

- To include the protoype in the readMe
- We have discussed how we need to include instructions to our app somewhere
- We have organised a stand up for 19.03.21 to discuss what we think we need to learn
  as a group in order to build this app from a technical perspective


Scoping:

Conceptual scope:

- A key challenge will be getting this app in front of people who might need it most 
(i.e. potentially older people who consume the same form of media from the same outlet on a regular basis) 
vs younger, politically engaged people more likely to use the app

Technical Scoping:

- MVP will have no user session ID or individual user data persisted. 
- Instead, we will hold overall data in our database.

Evaluation scope:
- We can use our survey for evaluation
- Additionally, we can use our database statistics to show how popular the app is
