General discussion:

- To include the protoype in the readMe
- We have discussed how we need to include instructions to our app somewhere
- We have organised a stand up for 19.03.21 to discuss what we think we need to learn
  as a group in order to build this app from a technical perspective


Scoping:

Conceptual scope:
- We are looking to raise awareness about media bias, and consequently encourage people to be more aware of the 
 news they consumer and how it might be biased. Hopefully it will lead people to critically
 question the news that they consume, and therefore bring a more balanced view to peeople' political stance.
- A key challenge will be getting this app in front of people who might need it most 
(i.e. potentially older people who consume the same form of media from the same outlet on a regular basis) 
vs younger, politically engaged people more likely to use the app
- Therefore target audience not completely defined yet!

Technical Scoping:

- MVP will have no user session ID or individual user data persisted. 
- Instead, we will hold overall data in our database.
- we will make calls to a twitter API and store the data in our database, ready to be used by the SPA and the user.
- Therefore this data is not live - it is retrieved on a scheduled timer via a cron job
- We can gain more tickets and features in the backlog through user stories identified in conversations with users.

Evaluation scope:
- We can use our survey for evaluation (link provided in the readMe)
- it will be evaluated throughout - we are actively seeking feedback from friends, family, colleagues
- Additioanlly, the survey is inteneded mostly for when people have used the app
- We can use our database statistics which will show number of users
