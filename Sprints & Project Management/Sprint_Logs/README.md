We ran weekly Sprints, commencing on 29th March 2021.

## Sprint 1, 29/03/21 - 05/04/21
The main goal of our first Sprint was for everyone to get up to date with the technical worksheets.

We also aimed to distribute our user survey, perform moderated user tests, and to start scraping data from Twitter and importing into MongoDB.

The sprint was successful and all our tickets were completed.
