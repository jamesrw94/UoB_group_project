We ran weekly Sprints, commencing on 29th March 2021.

## Sprint 1, 29/03/21 - 05/04/21
The main goal of our first Sprint was for everyone to get up to date with the technical worksheets.

We also aimed to distribute our user survey, perform moderated user tests, and to start scraping data from Twitter and importing into MongoDB.

The sprint was successful and all our tickets were completed.

Tickets completed were:
* Make the brexit background picture
* Perform moderated user tests
* Add twitter csv files into MongoDB - although we kept the ticket open after sprint completed as we wanted to add next week's files in as well.
* Update survey questions
* Get up to date with worksheets
* Distribute survey


## Sprint 2, 05/04/21 - 12/04/21
The main goals of Sprint 2 were:
* Frontend - get up routing and title page components
* Backend - create functions to pull tweets from DB
* UX - perform user tests

The full list of tickets were:
1. Set up routing for components
2. Create report based on moderated user tests
3. Perform show and tells
4. Create function to pull tweets from db
5. Ensure docker image works when pulling from github
6. Consider using dockerhub if docker images not working on github
7. Create topic page component
8. Create title page component
9. Add twitter csv file into MongoDB
10. Choose types of button for title page

Sprint Review:
All tickets were successfully completed. Some points to note were:
* Routing was successfully set up using child component loading. This method of routing could then easily be replicated for other components.
* We considered using using dockerhub to publish our docker image as we weren't sure that docker would work from github  but this was based more out of inexperience using docker. Additionally, we were considering using volumes to persist data, but realised that this would not work between machines. Therefore, we used a script which users must use in order to seed the database. Of course, if the app ever ended up being deployed into a production environment publically, we would be able to use volumes.
* Show and tells were performed within our group. Members of the group would show what they have been working on, including code walk-throughs, which we found to be very useful for everyone to keep abreast of technical and non-technical work.
