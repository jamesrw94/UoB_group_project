# Introduction
Know the News is a single page web app built to raise awareness of one’s own bias towards the media. As our consumption of media content becomes ever more automated with evolving technologies, one might understandably stereotype media outlets as presenting a consistent, politically biased opinion [1][2].

Our application hopes to show people how well they really know the voice of newspapers, by presenting an interactive quiz-style game. The game works by displaying tweets from various newspapers to the user, and then asking the user to match the tweets with their corresponding newspapers. After this, the application tells the user how well they’ve done, as well as provide information on how well people using the application have done in general.

How does it work?
The user selects from a list of pre-defined categories believed to be politically divisive, after which the user is taken to the quiz page. The quiz page displays random tweets on the selected topic from a database which regularly updates through contacting the Twitter API. The tweets are displayed on screen, and users must click-and-drag them to the correct newspaper logo they belong to.

Project Objectives:
1.	Design and build a functioning single page web application with quiz game functionality
2.	Populate database using Twitter API
3.	Present information back to the user on how accurately they Know the News
4.	Demonstrate that this application can be used to highlight one’s awareness of their own bias towards the media
